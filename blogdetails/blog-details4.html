        Dynamic Programming (DP) is a powerful technique to solve complex problems efficiently.
        It involves breaking problems into smaller overlapping subproblems and storing their solutions.
        Top-down (memoization) and bottom-up (tabulation) are two popular DP approaches.
        Common DP problems include Fibonacci sequence, knapsack problem, and shortest path algorithms.
        DP reduces computational complexity by avoiding repeated calculations.
        Understanding DP patterns is crucial for competitive programming and real-world applications.
        Practicing DP problems improves logical thinking and optimization skills for developers.
